    <h1>Crepe Cakes</h1>

    <p>I've been enjoying making my own <strong>crepe cakes</strong> recently. I really like the soft texture and fruity flavors of it. There's a dessert shop called <a href="https://www.mangomangodessert.com/">MangoMango</a> that makes really tasty crepe cakes. I followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfGjDceNRVo&t=588s">this tutorial</a> to learn how to make crepes, then layered it with whipped cream, jelly, and fruit to make the cake.</p>
